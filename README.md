# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a tumor is **Cancerous** or **Non-Cancerous** based on several medical features. The model is trained on a dataset of breast cancer characteristics and can be used to assist in early detection of breast cancer.
