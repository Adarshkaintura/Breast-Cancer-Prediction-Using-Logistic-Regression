# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a tumor is **Cancerous** or **Non-Cancerous** based on several medical features. The model is trained on a dataset of breast cancer characteristics and can be used to assist in early detection of breast cancer.

## Features:
- Predicts if the tumor is **Cancerous** or **Non-Cancerous** based on various medical attributes such as radius, texture, perimeter, and more.
- A simple and interactive interface built with **Streamlit**.
- The app uses **Logistic Regression** for classification.
